      <p>
        This policy describes what data {APP.name} collects, why we collect it,
        and the rights you have over it. We aim to write it in plain language —
        if anything is unclear, write to{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${APP.supportEmail}`}>{APP.supportEmail}</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
      <h3>Account</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Email address (required to log in)</li>
        <li>Display name (you set this; defaults to your email prefix)</li>
        <li>Password — stored only as a bcrypt hash; we never see the plaintext</li>
        <li>Role (pet owner, veterinarian, pet sitter, or admin)</li>
        <li>Preferred language and email-preferences flags</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pet data you enter</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pet profile: name, species, breed, sex, birth date, photo, bio</li>
        <li>Health metrics you log: weight, temperature, heart rate, mood,
          energy, anxiety, socialization</li>
        <li>Vaccination, medication, and clinical-record entries</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Activity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookings you make with vets or sitters</li>
        <li>Reviews you write</li>
        <li>Orders you place and products you list in the marketplace</li>
        <li>Adoption listings and applications you submit</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To run the service: render your dashboard, compute wellness signals,
          process orders, deliver email notifications</li>
        <li>To send transactional email (vaccination reminders, health alerts,
          order confirmations, booking reminders)</li>
        <li>To send the optional welcome onboarding series — opt-out from the
          email footer or in Settings → Email preferences</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> sell your data, share it with advertisers,
        or use it to train AI models.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Service providers</h2>
      <p>
        {APP.name} relies on a small set of vendors to operate. Each has its
        own privacy practices; we share only the minimum data each one needs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — application hosting and edge delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Neon</strong> — managed PostgreSQL database (your data lives here)</li>
        <li><strong>Resend</strong> — transactional email delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Vercel Blob</strong> — pet avatar storage</li>
        <li><strong>Google</strong> — only if you sign in with Google OAuth</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use a small set of strictly-necessary cookies; details on the{" "}
        <Link href="/legal/cookies">cookie policy</Link> page.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Under GDPR (and similar laws elsewhere) you have these rights, all of
        which we make exercisable directly from your account:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> — download a copy of every row stored under
          your account from Settings → Your data, or via{" "}
          <code>GET /api/account/export</code></li>
        <li><strong>Erasure</strong> — delete your account and all related data
          from Settings → Danger zone. The deletion cascades through pets,
          metrics, vaccinations, records, bookings, orders, listings, and
          applications. This is irreversible.</li>
        <li><strong>Rectification</strong> — edit any of your data directly in
          the app</li>
        <li><strong>Portability</strong> — the export above is JSON, suitable
          for moving to another service</li>
        <li><strong>Object / restrict</strong> — opt out of the welcome email
          series at any time; transactional emails remain because they&apos;re
          necessary for the service you signed up for</li>
        <li><strong>Lodge a complaint</strong> — with your local data
          protection authority</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your data for as long as your account exists. When you delete
        your account, the cascade removes everything immediately. Transactional
        email logs at our email provider may persist for a short period for
        deliverability auditing.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. All traffic to {APP.name} is served
        over HTTPS. Database connections use TLS. No system is perfectly
        secure — if we ever discover a breach affecting your data, we will
        notify you without undue delay.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        If we materially change this policy we will update the effective date
        above and notify active users by email.
      </p>
