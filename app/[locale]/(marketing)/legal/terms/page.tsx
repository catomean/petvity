      <p>
        These terms govern your use of {APP.name}. By creating an account you
        agree to them. If you don&apos;t, please don&apos;t use the service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The service</h2>
      <p>
        {APP.name} is a platform for tracking pet wellness, connecting with
        veterinarians and pet sitters, buying and selling pet products, and
        listing or finding pets for adoption. We provide the platform; you
        provide the data and the relationships with other users.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Your account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be 16 or older (or the digital-consent age in your jurisdiction)</li>
        <li>Provide accurate information; keep your credentials secure</li>
        <li>You&apos;re responsible for everything that happens under your account</li>
        <li>One person per account; one account per person, except where you
          legitimately operate distinct vet/sitter business profiles</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Impersonate someone else, including other users, vets, or {APP.name} staff</li>
        <li>Post false information about your pets, listings, or services</li>
        <li>Harass, threaten, or harm other users — owners, vets, sitters, adopters</li>
        <li>Submit fraudulent adoption applications or marketplace orders</li>
        <li>Scrape, mass-export, or attempt to reverse-engineer the platform</li>
        <li>Upload malware, attempt to breach security, or interfere with operation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these rules, with or
        without notice depending on severity.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Veterinary advice disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>{APP.name} is not a substitute for professional veterinary
        care.</strong> Wellness signals, range checks, and reminders are
        informational tools to help you spot changes early. They do not
        diagnose disease. If your pet shows symptoms or you have any concern
        about their health, contact a licensed veterinarian. In an emergency,
        call your nearest emergency vet immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        Sellers (other users or {APP.name} as a platform) list products at
        their own discretion. {APP.name} facilitates the transaction but is
        not a party to peer-to-peer sales. Sellers are responsible for
        accurate descriptions, lawful product offerings, and fulfillment.
        Buyers are responsible for reading listings carefully before ordering.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Adoption</h2>
      <p>
        {APP.name} facilitates adoption listings and applications. We do
        not verify the suitability of either the listing pet or the applicant.
        Owners and applicants are encouraged to meet, vet documentation, and
        follow local animal-adoption laws before any transfer takes place.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Bookings with vets and sitters</h2>
      <p>
        Bookings are agreements between you and the professional you book.
        {APP.name} provides the discovery, scheduling, and review surface.
        Disputes about service quality are between you and the professional;
        we may help mediate but are not the service provider.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You can delete your account at any time from Settings → Danger zone.
        We may terminate accounts for material breach of these terms or
        prolonged inactivity (with notice).
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent allowed by law, {APP.name} is provided &quot;as
        is&quot; without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for
        indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of
        the platform — including (but not limited to) decisions made based
        on wellness signals, marketplace transactions, or adoption matches.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms. The effective date above will reflect any
        change, and we&apos;ll notify active users by email of material changes.
      </p>
